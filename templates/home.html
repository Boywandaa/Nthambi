                    <p>Youth Centricity The Malawi population is youthful, with 51 percent under
                        18 years of age as of 2018. This necessitates that the youth should be central
                        in defining national development priorities. Economic empowerment of the
                        youth would thus cause a significant shift in the economic transformation of
                        the country. Despite their significant proportion, presently and as projected in
                        the future, young people are often faced with age-related challenges and
                        barriers, such as technical and financial capacities. These affect their active
                        participation in economic, political and social life, greatly hindering their
                        development and, consequently, their effective contribution to sustainable
                        economic development</p>
